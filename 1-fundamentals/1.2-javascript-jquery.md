# Javascript/jQuery

Javascript is a very large subject matter, and the presumption is that you
understand at least the bare essentials to take the certification exam, and
there are plenty of places to learn Javascript online. As such the notes for
this section will just cover Drupal-related Javascript topics.

One change from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8, is that jQuery is no longer automatically
loaded. This means jQuery must be manually pulled in as a dependency. There are
examples of that below.

## Adding Javascript Libraries
Theme and module Javascript should be loaded in using asset libraries
(i.e. `*.libraries.yml` files where `*` is the name of the theme or module).

### Local Javascript Libraries

Suppose you have a theme named `mytheme`, which needs to include the
following Javascript files:

```
fancy-ui-tabs.js
fancy-ui-accordion.js
fancy-ui-tables.js (dependent on underscore and jQuery)
```

It would follow that you would create `mytheme.libraries.yml` with the following contents:
```
fancy-ui:
  version: 1.x
  js:
    js/fancy-tabs.js: {}
    js/fancy-accordion.js: {}
fancy-ui-tables:
  version: 1.x
  js:
    js/fancy-tables.js: {}
  dependencies:
    - core/underscore
    - core/jquery
```

### External Javascript Libraries
Though it can be problematic for performance and security reasons, there are times when you will need to load external Javascript into your site.

For example loading AngularJS via a CDN, from [Adding stylesheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS) to a Drupal 8 theme](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/theming-drupal-8/adding-stylesheets-css-and-javascript-js-to-a-drupal-8-theme):
```
angular.angularjs:
  remote: https://github.com/angular
  version: 1.4.4
  license:
    name: MIT
    url: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/LICENSE
    gpl-compatible: true
  js:
    https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.4/angular.min.js: { type: external, minified: true }
```

## Attaching Javascript
Once libraries have been defined, they need to be attached were they are needed.

### Attaching to All Pages
To attach Javascript to all pages:

Under the `libraries:` section of `mytheme.info.yaml`:
```
libraries:
  - 'mytheme/global-styling'
  - 'mytheme/bootstrap-scripts'
  - 'mytheme/fancy-ui'
```

### Attaching to a Subset of Pages
You can use [hooks](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21core.api.php/group/hooks/8.2.x) to add conditionally.

For example, to only load on nodes (skipping other entities), add the following
function to your `mytheme.theme` file.  
```
function mytheme_preprocess_node(&$variables) {
  $variables['#attached']['library'][] = 'mytheme/fancy-tables';
}
```

Or if you only want to load on the maintenance page:
```
function mytheme_preprocess_maintenance_page(&$variables) {
  $variables['#attached']['library'][] = 'mytheme/fancy-tables';
}
```

## Drupal.behaviors

Instead of using `$(document).ready(function() {})`, as is common in jQuery
development, it is better to make use of `Drupal.behaviors` as it will ensure
code runs on normal page loads, ajax calls and inside [BigPipe](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/bigpipe/overview).

Example from [Javascript API Overview](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/javascript-api/javascript-api-overview):
```
Drupal.behaviors.myBehavior = {
  attach: function (context, settings) {
    // Using once() to apply the myCustomBehaviour effect when you want to do just run one function.
    $(context).find('input.myCustomBehavior').once('myCustomBehavior').addClass('processed');

    // Using once() with more complexity.
    $(context).find('input.myCustom').once('mySecondBehavior').each(function () {
      if ($(this).visible()) {
          $(this).css('background', 'green');
      }
      else {
        $(this).css('background', 'yellow').show();
      }
    });
  }
};
```

`attach()` is called once the DOM has loaded for all `Drupal.behaviors` properties,
both on the initial page load, and any subsequent ajax calls.

## Closures
Since Drupal's implementation of jQuery uses [`jQuery.noConflict()`](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/), it is also
considered good practice to wrap your custom Drupal javascript inside of a
closure like this:

```
(function ($, Drupal) {
  Drupal.behaviors.myModuleBehavior = {
    ...
  };
})(jQuery, Drupal);
```
