# Twig Syntax

From [Twig in Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/theming/twig):
> Twig is a template engine for PHP and it is part of the Symfony2 framework.
>
> In Drupal 8 Twig replaces PHPTemplate as the default templating engine. One of the results of this change is that all of the theme_* functions and PHPTemplate based `*.tpl.php` files have been replaced by `*.html.twig` template files.

## Printing Variables and Functions
Twig uses `{{ }}` syntax to output data.

- `{{ 3 }}` will output the integer `3`.
- `{{ 'xyz' }}` will output the string `xyz`
- `{{ myvar }}` will output the variable `myvar`
- `{{ someFunction }}` will output the results of `someFunction()`
- `{{ someFunction(foo, bar) }}` will out put the results of `someFunction(foo, bar)`

### Arrays and Objects
Array items and object properties/methods can be accessed using a dot (`.`):
```
{{ foo.0 }}
{{ foo.bar }}
{{ foo.method }}
{{ foo.method(baz) }}
```

This allows themers to not worry about variable types, and just output the data.

Array items can also be accessed using the subscript syntax (`[]`):
```
{{ foo[0] }}
{{ foo['bar'] }}
```

From [Twig for Template Designers](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/2.x/templates.html):
> For convenience's sake `foo.bar` does the following things on the PHP layer:
> - check if `foo` is an array and `bar` a valid element;
if not, and if `foo` is an object, check that `bar` is a valid property;
> - if not, and if `foo` is an object, check that `bar` is a valid method (even if `bar` is the constructor - use `__construct()` instead);
> - if not, and if `foo` is an object, check that `getBar` is a valid method;
> - if not, and if `foo` is an object, check that `isBar` is a valid method;
> - if not, and if `foo` is an object, check that `hasBar` is a valid method;
> - if not, return a `null` value.
> `foo['bar']` on the other hand only works with PHP arrays:
> - check if `foo` is an array and `bar` a valid element;
> - if not, return a `null` value.

If you need access a dynamic attribute:

```
{{ attribute(foo, 'data-foo') }}
```

## Executing Statements:
Twig uses `{% %}` syntax to execute statements.

### Setting Variables:
```
{% set x = 123 %}
{% set name = 'Name: !name'|t('!name', list.name) %}
```

### Conditionally Outputting a Region:
```
{% if message %}
 <div class="message">{{ message }}</div>
{% endif %}
```

### Looping:
```
<ul>
{% for item in list %}
  <li>{{ item.title }}: ${{item.price}}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

## Commenting
Twig uses `{# #}` syntax or comments.

```
{# Comments go inside these brackets. #}
```

You can also do multiline comments:
```
{#
  This comment spans
  multiple lines.
#}
```

A notable use for this is the twig file DocBlock. For example:

```
{#
/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation for a region.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - content: The content for this region, typically blocks.
 * - attributes: Remaining HTML attributes for the element, including:
 *   - class: HTML classes that can be used to style contextually through CSS.
 *
 * @see template_preprocess_region()
 *
 * @ingroup themeable
 */
#}
```

### Filters
Filters can be used to modify variables and expressions.

```
{{ "Some String"|t }}
```

Here are some common Drupal-specific filters:
- `trans`/`t`: Runs variable through Drupal `t()` function. (Note: Do not pass variables through the translation filter as this is a potential security vulnerability.)
- `placeholder`: Escapes content to HTML and passes through `drupal_placeholder()`, which emphasizes text (i.e. `<em>foo</em>`).
- `clean_class`: Prepares a string for use as a class name.
- `clean_id`: Prepares a string for use as an id.
- `format_date`: Prepares a timestamp for use as a formated date.
- `raw`: Marks value as being safe which means no escaping will take place. This should be avoided if possible.
- `render`: Wrapper for the `render()` function.
- `safe_join`: Joins several strings together with a specified separated (e.g. `{{ foo|safe_join(':') }}`)
- `without`: Duplicates an array, excluding specified keys (e.g. `{{ foo|without('bar', 'baz') }}`)

## Macros
From [Twig's official macro documentation](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/2.x/tags/macro.html):

> Macros are comparable with functions in regular programming languages. They are useful to put often used HTML idioms into reusable elements to not repeat yourself.

> Here is a small example of a macro that renders a form element:
>
```
{% macro input(name, value, type, size) %}
   <input type="{{ type|default('text') }}" name="{{ name }}" value="{{ value|e }}" size="{{ size|default(20) }}" />
{% endmacro %}
```
>
> Macros differ from native PHP functions in a few ways:
> - Default argument values are defined by using the default filter in the macro body;
> - Arguments of a macro are always optional.
> - If extra positional arguments are passed to a macro, they end up in the special `varargs` variable as a list of values.
> But as with PHP functions, macros don't have access to the current template variables.
