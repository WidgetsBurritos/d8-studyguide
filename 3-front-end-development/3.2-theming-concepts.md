# Theming Concepts

Drupal 8 introduced a new theming layer that helps reduce complexity for
designers and frontend developers. The [Mobile Initiative](https://groups.drupal.org/mobile/drupal-8) focused on making Drupal mobile-friendly right out of the box by making all themes responsive and implementing numerous frontend performance improvements. The [Drupal HTML5 Initiative](https://groups.drupal.org/html5) brought HTML 5 into core and allows for increased frontend functionality and improved accessibility.

Another major change is the introduction of Twig as the default templating engine.
See [Twig Syntax](3.3-twig-syntax.md) and [Twig Templates](3.4-twig-templates.md) for more information about using Twig.

## Theme Configuration

All available themes can be found in the `Appearance` page.

![Change Default Theme](images/appearance-1.png "Change Default Theme")

You can change the default frontend theme by clicking `Set as default` next to the theme
you wish to activate.

---

![Change Administration Theme](images/appearance-2.png "Change Administration Theme")

You can change the default admin theme by change the `Administration theme`
dropdown value and clicking the save button.

---

If a theme hasn't been installed yet, you will need to install to enable it.

![Install a Theme](images/appearance-2.png "Install a Theme")

To do so, just click `Install` or `Install and set as default` for the theme
you wish to enable.

---

Default themes can also be set in your `system.theme.yml` configuration file.

For example:
```
admin: seven
default: bartik
```

---

Additional theme settings can be set by clicking `Settings` next to the theme
you wish to change.
