# Menus

From [drupal.org - Concept: Menu](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/menu-concept.html):
> Menus are a collection of links (menu items) used to navigate a website. The core Menu UI module provides an interface to control and customize the menu system. Menus are primarily displayed as a hierarchical list of links. By default, new menu items are placed inside a built-in menu labeled Main navigation, but administrators can also create custom menus.
>
> The core Standard installation profile contains five menus:
>
> **Main navigation**
>
>   Links to sections intended for site visitors. They are usually created by site administrators.
>
> **Administration**
> - Links to administrative tasks. This menu mainly contains links supplied by modules on your site.
>
> **User account menu**
> - Links to tasks associated with the user account such as My account and Log out.
>
> **Footer**
> - Links to important pages within the site intended for the footer. They are usually created by site administrators.
>
> **Tools**
> - Links to tasks necessary for site visitors. Some modules feature their links here.

## Menu Placement

Menus are exposed in Drupal 8 as block, so you can use standard block placement to insert a menu onto your site.
