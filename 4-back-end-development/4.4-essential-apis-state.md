# State API

From [State API Overview](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/state-api/overview):
> The State API provides a place for developers to store information about the system's state. State information differs from configuration in the following ways:
>
> It is specific to an individual environment.
> You will never want to deploy it between environments.
> You can reset a system, losing all state. Its configuration remains.
> So, use State API to store transient information, that is okay to lose after a reset. Think: CSRF tokens, tracking when something non-critical last happened â€¦
> A good example of state is the last time cron was run. This is specific to an environment and has no use in deployment. The state API is a simple system to store this information, which previously would have been stored in the variables system.

## Usage:

```php
<?php
// Retrieve the key value.
$key = \Drupal::state()->get('key');

// Retrieve multiple key values.
$keys = \Drupal::state()->getMultiple(['key1', 'key2', 'key3']);

// Set key value
\Drupal::state()->set('key','value');

// Set multiple key values
\Drupal::state()->setMultiple(['key1' => 'value1', 'key2' => 'value2']);

// Delete key
\Drupal::state()->delete('key');
?>
```
