# Render API

Make sure you understand the [Routing System](4.4-essential-apis-routing.md) before continuing.

From [Render API](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/render-api):
> Drupal 8's Render API roughly consists of two parts:
>
> 1. The render pipeline â€” which is format-agnostic (HTML, JSON, anything)
> 2. Render arrays, which are a representation of a HTML page. They allow nesting (like HTML) and altering (necessary for Drupal's flexibility)

## Render Pipeline

For easier viewing, download the Render Pipeline diagram below:

1. If a route controller returns a `Response` object, the response is sent back to the browser and the remaining steps are bypassed. Otherwise, the `VIEW` event is triggered.
2. `MainContentViewSubscriber` subscribes to the `VIEW` event. Upon event fire, it checks to see if the controller result is a render array. If not the request dies, otherwise it guarantees to generate a `Response`.
3. `MainContentViewSubscriber` checks to see if a main content renderer service exists for the requested format. If not, a `406 Not Acceptable` response is generated and the remaining steps are bypassed.
4. Otherwise, a response is generated by calling `MainContentRendererInterface::renderResponse()` on the service.

## Main Content Renderers

Drupal 8 comes with the following main content renderers:

- HTML: HtmlRenderer (`text/html`)
- AJAX: AjaxRenderer (`application/vnd.drupal-ajax`)
- Dialog: DialogRenderer (`application/vnd.drupal-dialog`)
- Modal: ModalRenderer (`application/vnd.drupal-modal`)

## Render arrays

From [Render arrays](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/render-api/render-arrays):
> "Render Arrays" or "Renderable Arrays" are the building blocks of a Drupal page. A render array is an associative array which conforms to the standards and data structures used in Drupal's Render API. The Render API is also integrated with the Theme API.
>
> In many cases, the data used to build a page (and all parts of it) is kept as structured arrays until the final stage of generating a response. This provides enormous flexibility in extending, slightly altering or completely overriding parts of the page.

Example Render Array:
```php
<?php
$page = [
  '#type' => 'page',
  'content' => [
    'system_main' => [
      // ...
    ],
    'another_block' => [
      // ...
    ],
    '#sorted' => TRUE,
  ],
  'sidebar_first' => [
    // ...
  ],
];
?>
```

## Render Array Properties

- `#type` - Element type
- `#cache` - Mark the array as cacheable
- `#markup` - Provides HTML markup directly, which is passed through `\Drupal\Component\Utility\Xss::filterAdmin()`
- `#plain_text` - Provides text needing escaping (has precedence over `#markup`)
- `#prefix` - String prepended to the element being rendered
- `#suffix` - String appended to the element being rendered
- `#pre_render` - Functions that may alter render array before being rendered
- `#post_render` - Functions that operate on rendered HTML
- `#theme` - Single function that will be responsible for rendering the element
- `#theme_wrappers` - Array of theme hooks that add to the rendering after children have been rendered and placed into `#children`.
