# Update API

From [Introduction to update API for Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/update-api/introduction-to-update-api-for-drupal-8):
> You need to provide code that performs an update to stored data whenever your module makes a change to its data model. A data model change is any change that makes stored data on an existing site incompatible with that site's updated codebase.

Examples of data model changes may include:
- Changes to content entities and fields
- Changes to configuration
- Changes to schema

All data model changes should go into a `hook_update_N()` function.

For example, assume you have a module called `bestmoduleever`. In your `bestmoduleever.install` file you would add this code:
```
/**
 * Briefly explain what your update does here.
 */
function mymodule_update_8001(&$sandbox) {
  // Your update code here.
}
```

The value of `N` should get set based on this criteria from [Introduction to update API for Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/update-api/introduction-to-update-api-for-drupal-8):
> - 1 digit for Drupal core compatibility (8)
> - 1 digit for your module's major release version. For instance, if you're developing for Drupal Core and its version 8.0.x, use 0, and if its version 8.1.x, use 1, etc. If you're in a contrib or custom module, and its version 8.x-1.x, use 1, etc.
> - 2 digits for sequential counting, starting with 01. (Note: starting at 01 is required. Starting at 00 can cause system schema corruption.)
