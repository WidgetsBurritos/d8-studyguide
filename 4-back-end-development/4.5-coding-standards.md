# Coding Standards

Drupal coding standards are loosely based on [PEAR coding standards](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php). Due to the large volume of standards it is recommended you refer to [drupal.org - Coding Standards](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/) for more information.
