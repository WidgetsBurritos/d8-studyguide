# Drupal 8 Certification Study Guide

Notes based on the [Acquia Certified Drupal 8 Developer Study Guide](https://acquia-academy.gitbooks.io/study-guide-acquia-certified-drupal-8-developer/content/study-guide.html) and other resources.

For the record, I officially passed my exam on 4/24/2017 at DrupalCon Baltimore.

There are still some sections still missing from the below documentation, but I will continue filling sections out to make a more complete study guide over the next few months. Feel free to open PRs, adding new info and correcting any mistakes you may find.

It is highly recommended that you also read the [Drupal 8 User Guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/index.html) as much of the site building section (including the missing notes in this repo) covers what is in the user guide.
